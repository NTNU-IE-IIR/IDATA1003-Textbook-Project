# Animal Monitoring System

## Versions

v1 - Using traditional loops (for- and while)

v2 - Using lamda and Streams

v3 - Adding a menu system on top of lamda and streams
and added **packages** to the project. Also the AnimalMonito-class here 
contains both the "traditional" and the "new" way (lambda and streams) of doing things.
